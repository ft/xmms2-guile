XMMS2 client library for GNU guile
----------------------------------

This is  a native implementation  of the control  protocol for the  XMMS2 audio
playback server application. The library  is written in Scheme and specifically
targets the GNU Guile implementation of the language.

The  actual command  set for  the protocol  is generated  from XMMS2's  ipc.xml
definition file. The code in ‘scheme/constants’ and in ‘scheme/ipc’ is directly
generated from said definition.


Documentation
-------------

At this  point in  time, the  library lacks documentation  other than  the doc-
strings from  its source code.  The ‘doc’  sub-directory, thus far,  contains a
document,  that  basically  reflects  a  couple of  notes  about  the  protocol
implemented by the  library, that were taken during development.  It is neither
complete  nor does  it claim  to  be any  sort  of an  authoritative source  of
information about the protocol. And it was never proof-read by anyone who knows
the protocol,  so bugs are likely.  Hence the subtitle “An  Unreliable Hacker’s
Guide”.


Dependencies
------------

The library requires the use of an XMMS2 snapshot (0.8DrO_o-947-g3bd868a at the
time of writing), as well as GNU  Guile 2.0. The documentation inside the ‘doc’
sub-directory is generated from markdown  sources to their target formats using
pandoc. Generating  PDF versions  of the documentation  will require  a working
LaTeX installation.

Moreover, running the test-suite required the ‘scm-test-tap’ package from:

    https://github.com/ft/scm-test-tap


Installation
------------

% ./generate-ipc-from-xml ~/src/xmms2/src/ipc.xml
% make doc
% make byte-compile
% make test
(…and as root…)
# ./install


Examples
--------

The ‘examples’ sub-directory  contains a couple of programs  using the library,
that were and are written as experiments  to test the library against an actual
XMMS2 server.

Because they  are mainly used during  development, they do not  necessarily use
the most elegant solution to a  given problem, but rather something that worked
at the time. This may improve in the future.

Also note,  that because of  their development-aiding purpose, the  examples do
not connect the  default XMMS2 server socket,  but instead use a  version of it
that  is piped  through socat.  In order  to get  such a  socat session  up and
running, use the following command in a separate terminal:

  % socat -t100 -x -v \
      UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/xmms-ipc-"$USER".socat,mode=700,reuseaddr \
      fork \
      UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/xmms-ipc-"$USER"

Note that piping through socat significantly impacts performance.
